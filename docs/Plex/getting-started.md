# Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with accessing and enjoying the media content on OwlworkingLate Plex server. Plex is a fantastic platform for streaming movies, TV shows, music, and more from my personal library to your devices. Whether you're using a computer, phone, smart TV, or streaming device, it's straightforward once set up. If you run into issues, feel free to reach out.

##Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

A free Plex account. If you don't have one, sign up at plex.tv – it's quick and doesn't require a credit card.
The Plex app installed on your device(s). Download options include:

Web browser: Access via app.plex.tv
Mobile: Plex app from the App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android)
Smart TVs/Streaming Devices: Search for Plex in your device's app store (e.g., Roku, Fire TV, Apple TV, Android TV)
Desktop: Plex Media Player for Windows/Mac


A stable internet connection. For the best experience, use Wi-Fi or a wired connection, especially for HD/4K content.
An invitation from me. I'll send you an email invite or a share link to join my server.

Note: Plex works best on modern devices. If you're using an older one, check Plex's system requirements on their website.

## Accepting the Invitation

Check your email for an invitation from me (it'll come from Plex or my email address).
Click the "Accept Invitation" link in the email.
If prompted, sign in to your Plex account (or create one if you haven't).
Once accepted, my server will appear in your Plex dashboard under "Libraries" or "Servers."
Pro Tip: Enable "Remember Me" for easier future logins, but avoid this on shared devices.

If I shared a direct link instead of an email:

Click the link.
Sign in to Plex.

## Accessing My Server

After signing in, look for the sidebar or menu (usually on the left).
Under "Libraries," you should see sections like Movies, TV Shows, Music, etc., from my server.
If you don't see my libraries:

Click your profile icon (top right) > "Authorized Devices" or "Servers" to ensure my server is listed.
Refresh the app or restart it.

## Navigating the Plex Interface
Plex's interface is user-friendly and similar across devices:

Dashboard/Home: Shows recently added content, watchlists, and recommendations.
Libraries: Browse by category (e.g., Movies, TV). Use search (magnifying glass icon) to find specific titles.
Filters and Sorting: Sort by title, year, rating, or genre. Filter unwatched content.
Details Page: Click a title for synopsis, cast, ratings, and playback options.
Playlists and Watchlists: Create your own playlists or add items to your watchlist for later.

- Use any Plex player to test playback.
- Verify metadata and artwork.
