## Tips and Troubleshooting

-Buffering Issues: Lower the quality in settings, check your internet speed (Plex recommends 5Mbps+ for HD), or restart your router/app.
-Can't Find Server: Ensure I've shared the library with you specifically. Double-check your email for the invite.
-Device Limits: I might have set limits on simultaneous streams – if it's busy, try again later.
-Subtitles Not Working: Some content might not have them; I can add if requested.
-Updates: Keep your Plex app updated for the best performance.
-Security: Never share your Plex login with others. If you forget your password, reset it via plex.tv.
-Common Errors:

-"Server Unavailable": My server might be offline – I'll restart it if needed.
-"Unauthorized": Re-accept the invite or contact me to re-share.



-If something's not working, provide details like your device, what you're trying to do, and any error messages. Enjoy the content, and happy streaming!
